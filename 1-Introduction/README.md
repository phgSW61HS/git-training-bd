# Introduction

For all this training, we will discover how the devops fundamentals can help us delivering a high quality project and ease the different release steps.
During all the training, we will simulate to start a new project where we want to deliver a MVP / POC to our client.
We don't really care about the language of the project (Python, js, scala, ...). We will focus on how develop it as a team.

## Section Contents

Here is an example of content sections with titles, subtitles. Important to integrate fully guide hands-on sections.

* [Git](#Git)
* [Docker](#Docker)
* [CI-CD](#CI-CD)

## Git

Imagine that you were first working alone on your project with all the files on your local machine.
Yet, a new colleague will join you in order to speed up the process.

How will you share the files with him, how will you ensure that you have the last version of a file, that you didn't change the same procedures or functions, ...

The Git presentation will highlights the best practices and give a brief introduction of the main features.

#### Docker

Now, imagine that a third person join the team while the project has been developed for quite some time. He would need to reinstall all the necessary libraries, languages, etc..
Depending on the project it can be quite long and fastidious. Imagine in addition that, all the members of the project are working with a different OS (Windows, Linux, Mac...), the version or dependencies are sometimes quite different and you can't be completely sure that something that works for you will work for someone else as well.
It can be quite time consuming.

It is where Docker can be your savor ! We'll see it in the Docker section.

## CI-CD

Finally, your prototype is finally over and you would like to ensure that any changes will be automatically tested and deployed in order to be sure to not have any regression in the code nor losing any time for deploying.

Gitlab CI-CD is one example of how you could do it.
