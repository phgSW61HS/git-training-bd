## Version control tool

#### What is version control

Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

Some of the key benefices of source control - that we will highlight further - can be summarize below:
- Prevent code loss
- Allowing several developpers/teams to work on the same project by keeping track of all changes
- Ensuring that no developers change the same part of codes without validated them
- Helping Devops team to automatically test and deploy codes
- ... many more.
